We tried implementing the Naughty-Nice List using Blockchain back in 2022 but Jack Frost hacked it and we are trying to find a suitable technical approach for securely storing it. Integrity is of critical importance.",

    "I've asked my fellow elves to help out with this, since I'm not the most tech-savvy of the bunch. Many got right to it, but some are being quite ho-hum about it. That seems a little strange to me, but maybe they're just tired from the journey home.",
    "I may not be the sharpest tool in the repository when it comes to the technical stuff, but it seems I'm quite the galvanizer!",
